# Mobile Number Recognition 

This is a python program which from a given textual data
detects mobile numbers in the ddd-ddd-dddd format wherein
the 'd' stands for digit. This is a very simple 
program which works in the command line.







## Installation and Usage

1) It is fairly easy to get this project up and running
on your PC with one simple git command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kazana666/1202-Assignment.git
  cd 1202-Assignment
```
If git is not installed please visit- 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
else download as a .zip file from github.


2) Using this clone command the whole prpject repository 
would be downloaded on your machine and then you can
access the main python program and execute it in 
the command line itself using this python command:

```bash
  python .\textRecogPrac.py
```
## Prerequisites for the program

The program has been designed in such a way that it
does not rely on any third party plugins for it to 
work, eventually not needing any external Prerequisites.
One however needs to ensure that python is installed on the machine 
for the program to be compiled and run properly

- Download python - https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe
- Download git - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git



## Running the project

1) To run this project first get in the folder directory where the file is saved

```bash
  cd 1202-Assignment
```

2) Now run the python command in the terminal
 which looks something like this:

 ```bash
  python ./mobileNumRecog.python
```
3) This will run the program and now you can input the data for the program to find out mobile numbers





## Usage/Examples

Down below is a visual demonstration of how to make the program work in its best capacity, also demonstrating the result/outcome from the
text input given to it showing the effective functionality of the program.

1) First we see how to navigate into the desired program so as to execute the program

2) Next we see how to execute the program, the results we obtain after giving an input

## Tech Stack

1) Since this is a fairly simple program using only python language there is not much to what follows in the tech stack.
2) However do take notice that the program might not run on python versions below 3.8 since it was built on python 3.8 



**Client:** Python 3.8




## Authors
Even though the program has been developed by me end to end, I would like to extend my gratitude
towards Al Sweigart and his book "Automate the boring stuff with python" which forms the baseline for the creation of this program
